            <br><br>Portable Network Graphics (PNG, officially pronounced /pɪŋ/[2][3] PING, colloquially pronounced /ˌpiːɛnˈdʒiː/[4] PEE-en-JEE) is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.[5] PNG was developed as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)—unofficially, the initials PNG stood for the recursive acronym "PNG's not GIF".[6]
<br><br>
PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with or without an alpha channel for transparency), and full-color non-palette-based RGB or RGBA images. The PNG working group designed the format for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics; therefore, non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK are not supported. A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of chunks, encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks documented in RFC 2083.[7]
<br><br>
PNG files have the ".png" file extension and the "image/png" MIME media type.[8] PNG was published as an informational RFC 2083 in March 1997 and as an ISO/IEC 15948 standard in 2004.[1]
